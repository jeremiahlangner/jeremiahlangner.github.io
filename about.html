		<h3>Bio</h3>
		<p>I have little desire to curate my own narrative. I've worked as an artist and designer in some professional capacity for over eight years. I've worked on a diversity of products and projects, and served in varying capacities ranging from low level labor and production to team leadership and management positions. I've worked in both creative and technical capacities on self-initiated and client projects. I prefer a healthy mixture of independent and collaborative projects.</p>
