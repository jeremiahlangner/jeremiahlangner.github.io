			<h3>Biography/About Me</h3>
			<p>I'm an illustrator and designer with a bent toward too much technical stuff. (To many people I'm known more as a developer.) I started freelancing right out of college both by necessity, and because I wanted to run something of a lifestyle business. I live to work. I work because the world has needs, and I want to address them. But work has to have its own measure of play, and life must have variety to promote more of it. I value human experience, plunging into the unknown, and attempting to further quantify the known. If I had one "dream-life" it might be to be among the first members of a crew attempting to colonize Mars.</p>
