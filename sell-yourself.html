title: Selling My "Self"

<h1>Selling My "Self"</h1>

<p>Upon Graduating from college in 2011 with only $100 to my name, no job prospects and a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from a Christian University in the Bible belt, I began a process of "soul-searching" that may never end. My art training was rather pop-centric. We learned from and to operate much like the pop artists from the 60s and 70s. I don't think that was the faculty's intent. Indeed the program was changing rather dramatically as I was on my way out. I was training to be a "studio artist." But I was trying for something very different. I was infatuated with illustration and animation and had obsessed over them since I read JRR Tolkien's <em>The Hobbit</em> when I was 13.</p>
<p>I say "infatuated" because I was truly in love with the words and ideas of dead men like JRR Tolkien, CS Lewis, others from their Inklings group, and eventually, George MacDonald and G.K. Chesterton. They all shared a similar affection for an authentic "joy," and otherworldliness that many would have described as "Romantic," but I can only now describe as a longing for a "true reality." Or rather, an identification with it, apart from the limitations of traditionalism yet within a framework of the good. </p>
<p>Toward the end of high school, I was introduced to the works of Francis Schaeffer. In my homeschooled environment, my parents probably wouldn't have been surprised that I latched onto his more academic language and presentation. However, they might have balked at buying his materials had they understood some of the underlying themes of what he presented. For better or worse, Schaeffer was my introduction to a more philosophically oriented way of understanding art. His critical posture provided much of my early framework for interpration and mastery as I moved on from high school into college, but as I delved more and more into practice, his ideas became suspect.</p>
<p>Reducing reality through epistemological critique causes art to suffer. Mystery and ambiguity are inherent to art. The nature of general revelation, in more theological terms, is that it is "general." God is. The world is. That is part of the "wonder." More explicit detail requires abstracting from what is, from experience, from specific revelation, to "know." It is an inherent flaw of "naming" that by naming a thing, we claim or exercise power to abstract it. We remove a degree of its specificity. Reliance on tradition, in some ways may lead to dilution of "knowing," because it makes things less discrete. All is not and cannot be "words."</p>
<p>In Christian society in general, not all of Christian society, but particular to the form of Christianity I grew up in, the end goal of art was the perfection of technique for the purpose of purer representation. The more closely the image represented perceptions, the more truth it reflected, or the greater the skill of the artist. If an artist could be a xerox machine or a camera the artist had reached the epitome of his or her profession. So by tradition, in a very protestant view, Art, as a practice, had reached its zenith under the Dutch masters.</p>
<p>My college experience and my own predisposition prevented me from accepting this view. It became colloquial. And now, I would venture even to label it "Satanic" in many ways. Schaeffer's view of art departed slightly from this view, but it never provided a framework of thought for practice of anything else. Schaeffer's philosophical children used Schaeffer's words to reinforce it. In the end the posture of critique espoused by Schaeffer seemed to offer more or different grounds for "posturing" without fully acknowledging the soul-crushing reality of "unknowing" many artists were trying to express.</p>
<p>I walked out of college into a world where I had no fit. I had skill, but nothing that paid to apply it to. I defaulted to everything I knew growing up. I mowed lawns, trimmed bushes, painted walls, and houses. I had a resume. I had nowhere to send it. I had no money to go anywhere else, and all I could do was labor to survive.</p>
<p>I regarded my "self" as something sacred. I gave up walking aisles in college because I felt as though my sensivity was being taken advantage of by people who were good at presenting messages in a standard formalized logic calculated to produce an emotional response. I watched as some of my friends were called out specifically from the pulpit in a crowd of 6000 by manipulative salesmen masquerading as evanglists. I listened as others labeled things as "evil" based on criteria, now accepted Christian canon, which were formulated by pagan Greek philosophers. And I slammed religious textbooks on the floor as their theologians castigated those they viewed as "liberal" for hermeneutical practices they were employing themselves to ground their entire system. I was tired of being used, taken advantage of, and manipulated, to do and be what a system prescribed apart from what I actually believed. I "cared," which is why I acted, and I was troubled that noone seemed to be able to speak for themselves apart from the script which they were fed. I almost wept as I discovered and drew away from "mentors" who felt inadequate because they could offer little more than what I had been taught by rote since I was a child and could parrot back. I was isolated in desiring a "wonder and wildness to God" when "there are all the answers," and the ones that weren't "there" shouldn't be inquired about.</p>
<p>To me, society is an inversion of what it should be, could be, and I hope will be. As I began to look for a job I meditated on the idea of "selling myself" and created my first portfolio website, which has now always been "under construction." In subscribing to a form of employment, I argued to myself, I would not be so much "selling out," as much as "buying in" to an opportunity to do what I wanted later onâ€“when I had money. Additionally my work ethic and level of energy guaranteed advancement wherever I went. I graduated from what some of my friends referred to as a "Christian military school," after all. But the process of gaining employment was too much like building a product out of the "self" for my taste.</p>
<p>I like building products, but "self" as product seemed like an inversion of the idea of personhood. Humans exist apart from their "usefulness." Utilitarian emphasis with regard to the "self" insures mental instability. We are born helpless. We will likely grow helpless as we age. And we will die "useless," covered in as much hair as we possessed when we were born. This fact ought not be ignored. People are not products. People possess agency. People are not mono-dimensional. The value of a "person" is more than the value of what he can do, or the value he or she can provide.</p>
<p>I am not my job. I am not an artist. I just can draw and paint. Sometimes I actually do. I am not a philosopher. I just think. I am not a programmer. I just write code. My identity is not a product of what I do. What I do is the technique. Technique springs out of identity and acts upon it reciprocally. But technique is not identity.</p>
<p>I resented the jobs on offer that asked me what I "was" and tried to define it by what I "do," and so I began to lash out in the work I made. I dressed my "self" up like a product. My webpage became a square like an old album cover. I turned a poor photo of my face upside down and inverted the values to express how upside down and inside out the idea of "presenting" is. I colored it with magenta and cyan and gave it grain and halftone dots as though it were mass-produced in The Factory. I then covered the page with machine-type. "American Typewriter." It was elegant. I left that web page up for over a year and never bothered to put up a portfolio of college works. My art from school was not marketable, and offering to create portraits that took 20+ hours to draw for negligible pay would not advance my prospects in the current market. I started serving sandwiches at a local deli instead.</p>
<p>Working two part-time jobs and attempting to create a career on the side eventually took its toll. Within 6 months of 3 hours of sleep at night, my kidneys started failing. I remember peeing blood for the first time on my birthday just after graduating from college. The initial shock at seeing it subsided into a calm panic over lack of money and health insurance. I never talked to anyone about it. Within a month, my boss at the deli told me to go home and get some rest because I looked like I had been doing meth. As a former cop, he would have known. I quit one of my jobs that week. I survived the holiday season at the other, and they didn't call me back in after New Years. I was effectively unemployed.</p>
<p>I wandered for 3-4 months, trying this and that on my own, for no pay. I began to conclude that a career in art was effectively impossible for me. I didn't want to do the hobnobbing and brown-nosing required of the practicing studio professional. My work wasn't even decorative. I ate bagels almost every morning at the same bagel restaurant, and ate lunch at Taco Bell, bouncing between nearby bookstores in-between. I "practiced" art without direction. I was constantly working to "put something in my portfolio," or at least to have skill that was "marketable." But nothing ever seemed to materialize. I was looking for some utilitarian purpose to my efforts, exercising an existential imperative to make my "essence," all while critiquing the emptiness of both.</p>
<p>Upon graduating from college my dad said to me "You got what you paid for." In effort. In paint. In oil. In dirt. In blood. In tears. In resentment. I am too much a "human." I am too much an "artist." I am too much a "Christian." I am too much a devil. I do too much and too little. I work too hard, and not enough. I've finished too much and too little. I've known too many people, and too few. I've suffered too much and nothing worth batting an eye at. Complexity and paradox are part of reality. Saints sin. People reap their own damnation and are damned. God sends rain on the evil and the good.</p>
<p>"Don't sell yourself short" is not advice enough to start a career. Don't sell your "self" at all. We are not in a traders' market. Sell something else entirely, and do good work.</p>
