<p style="text-align:center;"> At this point, I've disabled my twitter account because I've become so angry over the past few years that I'm seeking therapy to deal with it. My website has been neglected as I've invested much of my effort in caring for my clients' best interests. Below are a few of my thoughts. I hope to encourage consideration for others, and to discourage self-aggrandizement, of which I feel I am not innocent.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><em>Irrelevant to me, but of personal interest</em>, it seems gentrification may be detrimental to the communities being "gentrified" because they are being driven out of their own "affordable" housing. For example, a house boughttps://greenville.craigslist.org/pet/d/2-cats-shots-fixed-and-house/6589172051.htmlht locally 3 years ago for $73000 is now on the market for $399000. While this house has seen improvements since its purchase 3 years ago, the current asking price drives up the property value of the surrounding properties 100-200%. Property taxes, consequently, are raised equivalently (in my state). This means, for those who live in homes that they "own," their annual housing expenses have just doubled or tripled. Many of them, who live in the same area, making $16-20k per year will be forced out of their homes because they cannot afford to pay property taxes. Where will they go?</p>
