<p style="text-align:center;"> At this point, I've disabled my twitter account because I've become so angry over the past few years that I'm seeking therapy to deal with it. My website has been neglected as I've invested much of my effort in caring for my clients' best interests. Below are a few of my thoughts. I hope to encourage consideration for others, and to discourage self-aggrandizement, of which I feel I am not innocent.</p>

  <li><h3>Reneging on Your Agreements Condemns People to Hell</h3><p>I'm currently expriencing this, and have experienced this repeatedly throughout my freelance career. I began freelancing in 2011 after I graduated from college. One thing I have to say both to creators and their employers is this, if your creators fail to make what you want, you need to pay them for the effort. Creators, if you fail to make for your employers what they want, consider the time you put in, the equipment rentals, the software costs. Creators, you need to be paid for these, regardless of whether your employer accepts the product, if they agreed to pay you in the first place. Employers, you need to agree to pay creators in the first place. I've been in hell paying upwards of $1-2k for projects I never was paid for because I have started from a position of $0. Employers, pay something up front. Creators always risk. Creators, charge for "service" and expenses, and expect to be paid. Take it to court if it's worth it. It's better to make than to be dead because you can't afford to eat.</p>

<li><p style="text-align:left;"><em>Irrelevant to me, but of personal interest</em>, it seems gentrification may be detrimental to the communities being "gentrified" because they are being driven out of their own "affordable" housing. For example, a house bought locally (I won't link, to avoid "shaming" or "incriminating") 3 years ago for $73,000 is now on the market for $399,000. While this house has seen improvements since its purchase 3 years ago, the current asking price drives up the property value of the surrounding properties 100%-300%. Property taxes, consequently, are raised equivalently (in my state). This means, for those who live in homes that they "own," their annual housing expenses (in terms of property taxes, which are based on property values,) have just doubled or tripled. Many of them, who live in the same area, making $16-20k per year will be forced out of their homes because they cannot afford to pay property taxes. Where will they go?</p></li>
