title: On Creative Economies in the Church
---

<p>I sat in the service, like most Sundays, feeling like an outsider in the church I attended this morning. The lower middle-class Americans surrounding me made me feel at least on par socially, since we both could only afford clothing that didn’t set us apart from the rest of the people who shop at Wal-mart or the mall once a year. I listened to the sermon in a rather unattentive fashion, just like everyone else. I was more interested in hearing “how” the pastor presented what he was saying than in “what” he was saying. By now, the “what” is something I could recite by rote, or many variations of it. I wanted to know if he would address the abuses often levied from the words he preached. I wanted to know if he would care for the concerns of those most disenfranchised by society, or by the church as a whole. I let out a scoffing “snort” at one of his remarks thereby achieving my sense of catharsis for having “expressed myself.” “I am praying that a generation of Christians will rise up to communicate in creative and winsome ways…” I don’t remember exactly what it was he was praying they would communicate because the beginning of the statement was the end as far as I was concerned.</p> 
<p>More and more creatives, not without exception, are leaving or have already left many churches, or abandoned Christianity in general. My own disinterest with regard to the church is a symptom of a similar attitude toward the church or Christianity, as expressed in American and Western society. That is not to say it is “bad,” but problematic for most actively endeavoring to make a career in the arts. That is not to say that it should or shouldn’t be either. That’s a longer discussion and a digression. I can imagine one of the questions on everyone’s (who cares)  mind is “why?”
Anyone pursuing a creative career has made a difficult career choice. There are of course two primary concerns that affect everyone in contact with the artist’s work, the artist’s product and the artist’s process. Those who are more economically inclined tend to focus on the the utility of the work and its costs, monetarily, physically, emotionally, and psychologically. And those more ideologically inclined tend to focus on the philosophy influenced by or expressed in the work. In general, the abundance of art or craft in society reduces its value to near zero until it is imbued with more by some authority. Human “artfulness” flourishes throughout the world. A thing is valuable when it proves its worth in relation to the abundance around it. E.g. a drawing of a map for a fantasy story is valuable when the map serves to explain the spatial relationships in the geography in the story, helping the reader to understand the passage of time and space in the written work. The fantasy story is valuable when it provides myths offering examples both emotional and rational for explaining the workings of the world. A song played in response to the story is valuable in that it evokes an emotional context similar to what the author sought to provoke in his or her readers. Value for a work is subjective, but mostly “near zero,” except, in most cases, to the creative.</p>
<p>The majority of creatives begin creating from a position of “near zero.” Their only “power” is the collection of resources they are using to create their object, and the skills they have acquired through practice to execute the steps necessary to create that object. The means are varied. Some processes have been codified, and produce typically homogenous work–much of popular music, for example. Others are as diverse as their producers–stand-up comedy. In any case a creative must engage in a process in order to produce a product. Art always requires work. Artists who are able to practice their process–work–without much interference or interruption are able to produce more products. Artists who cannot practice are not able to produce. Artists who cannot produce no longer possess any “power.” One of the greatest risks to creative flourishing is losing the ability to practice. This is often effected by loss of resources or denial of ability to practice requisite skills.</p>
<p>Creatives often leave the church because it disenfranchises them both in the areas of resource and process.</p> 
<p>When God called the tabernacle to be built, He allocated resources, inviting the whole of Israel to give to its construction. “Here is the vision for the place where you will worship me; this is what it will take to produce.” And they did. When the temple was built, the workers were fed and housed for the months of their shift. The tabernacle and temple musicians were paid out of the tithes and offerings presented to the priests. Ezra and Nehemiah were given resources by the dominant kings of Persia to feed themselves and their laborers and to rebuild Jerusalem and its walls. Resources were pre-allocated, and compensation was predetermined at an acceptable labor rate. Some objects involved in the creation of these monuments were produced purely “for glory, and for beauty,” without any concern for utility in mind, and the craftsmen involved were suitably compensated for their labors.</p>
<p>The New Testament describes some of the early churches in Acts as “having all things in common” and describes some of the details of how individuals sacrificed their own for the collective good. I think this was intended as descriptive of an exception and not necessarily the rule in that it was recorded because it was a notable expression of how extreme was the love of the people in the church for one another. They voluntarily gave up all that they had in favor of one another for each others’ good. Now, this self-sacrifice was not made mandatory, as everywhere, Paul preached against compulsory giving. Peter castigated Ananias and Sapphira for lying about how much they gave and told them no one was forcing them to give. Giving to the church was “giving.” Laboring for the church was labor with an appropriate compensation. Paul called the church to pay its ministers citing passages from the Old Testament law such as “muzzle not the ox,” and “the laborer is worthy of his hire.”</p>  
<p>Many churches in America don’t pay their musicians. Many churches in America don’t pay their technicians. Many churches in America don’t pay their ushers, or stagehands, or camera crews, or projector operators, or graphic designers. There are an untold number of man-hours invested in the American church that are left largely uncompensated. While many of these positions are occupied by volunteers who give of their time to the church, there is a precedent that such positions are assumed to be without compensation. In a capitalist market, this is a social and moral ill.</p> 
<p>Most creatives are incredibly critical people in their own fields who readily recognize needs that they might be able to fill in the church. Sound technicians know when something sounds “off.” Musicians know when a piano is out of tune. Writers know when two words of text can make the difference between parents looking for their children in their regular Sunday School classroom or in the Children’s Church room after the service. Graphic designers know when the church’s logo looks “wonky” or is in an unreadable font with colors that hurt the eyes rather than reflecting a pleasant harmony that symbolically identifies the church and meaningfully introduces visitors and regulars to the church’s cultural and social context and emphasis. Visual artists know when their children’s Sunday School papers are just offering them another depiction of a renaissance idealized “white Jesus” in a staged pose with hand gestures that mean something completely different than what the Sunday School lesson was trying to teach. Critique is the easy part. But acting on a critique is much more difficult.</p>
<p>Completely recreating all of the church resources with a new logo is a long and expensive process. Physical objects don’t magically change, and the resources a church allocated with the old bad logo on them generally have to be used up before the new one can be implemented. Then, suppose someone else has a better idea for a logo after the new logo has been created. Now, the church has to change again because one of its creatives has a different opinion than another. Church politics and economics prevent making many changes. The church simply doesn’t possess the power to implement them. But, when and if it does, it must consider the concerns of its creatives if it is to employ them for its good.</p>
<p>Creatives are poor. We live in a global economy. This is great. An audience is there for anything that a creative can make. This is also terrible. The audience both considers the abundance of creativity throughout the world to render its value at “near zero,” and that creatives can labor at a near zero-cost rate to produce the products the audience binges on daily. They want a pretty good reason to pay more than their zero-cost valuation. Those who are able to make a living by restricting themselves to local markets already have established themselves by gaining enough clout to raise the local market’s general valuation of their labor. But those laboring in the global market are competing in a brutally cut-throat capitalist market for pay that would provide someone in China or India a moderate to high-level income, but would fail to even feed someone in the United States, let alone afford them the ability to pay their mortgage, their electric bill, their HOA fees, their internet expenses so they can continue to labor in a global market, their federally mandated health insurance costs, and their contract labor taxes, which, with near zero-cost production are substantial.</p> 
<p>Creativity takes time. No two artists draw exactly the same way. One artist may produce in 5 minutes what it takes another artist 4 hours to do. One artist may spend his entire life painting a painting that another artist could have done in 20 minutes. Techniques vary, and the perceptions of problems and means of solving them vary from artist to artist. It is the responsibility both of the church and the creative to ascertain whether the desired product may be produced in the time the church has allotted for the object to be finished. A symphony may be written in a flurry of activity, or it may take a musician’s entire lifetime. The concerns and values of a particular creative as well as the degree of his or her training are relevant factors in how much time any given project may take. Because creativity is work, and because much creative output is produced in a non-linear manner, time must be allotted for a creative to labor and make decisions about a particular project. The cathedrals throughout Europe were built intergenerationally with labor being passed on from father to son.</p> 
<p>“Rome wasn’t built in a day.”</p>	
<p>There are generally accepted ethical guidelines for hiring creatives in a corporate context. A graphic designer or illustrator might point to a copy of “The Handbook of Pricing and Ethical Guidelines” for specific projects or fields. This particular publication was created by the Graphic Artists Guild in order to help artists arrive at a fair and non-abusive labor relationship with their clients. Ignoring these guidelines often puts graphic artists at risk of harm as well as fostering a culture in which it is acceptable to redefine “fair” in favor of the client, the one who is, arguably, in the position of power in a service relationship.</p>
<p>Creatives are servants. They are being employed for the services they provide, and not necessarily their products. It is the hope of every good creative, and of every good client, that the product they produce as a result of their services is adequate to meet the needs, both real and perceived, of their client. It is, as much, the responsibility of the creative’s clients to treat them justly. Artist’s contracts often include “kill fees,” in which an artist is still compensated a partial sum of an agreed-upon rate if a project falls through. This is considered fair on the client’s part because they are paying for the creative’s services. The creative worked and is being compensated for their labor. “Do not muzzle the ox that treads out the corn.” And again, “The laborer is worthy of his hire.”</p>
<p>The church needs to recognize the creative’s economic constraints and present its needs with reference to the creative’s needs. The church needs to recognize that a creative can only give out of the abundance of what God gives, and that doing otherwise is a sacrifice on the part of the creative. Sacrifice costs. And it hurts. For a creative struggling to make what is considered a bottom line in America, it hurts in ways that are morally degrading and indescribably difficult. If the church is willing to offer compensation for a creative endeavor, they need to make this obvious up-front. Failing to do so is a deterrent to anyone capable of helping them, but struggling with the day-to-day. The creative needs to consider offering service as his or her “tithe.” Struggling to make ends meet makes every second precious. If a creative can freely and cheerfully give of their time and service to the church in lieu of money, why not do so? Churches, remember such service cannot and should not be compelled. “God loves a cheerful giver.” Compelling someone without rationalizable ability to exercise that ability in your favor is the equivalent of robbing the poor to feed the rich. You abuse your power and hurt yourself. Borrowing an analogy, if you punish an already weakened muscle you risk systemic injury.</p>
