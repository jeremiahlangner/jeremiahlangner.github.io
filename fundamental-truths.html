<p>This may be an ongoing series, so check back for updates. In college I began a series of artworks based on observations of what I had determined to be a creeping deadness I found among my peers. At the time, it seemed a result of a result of being thrust into a world which perpetually foiled their efforts and pushed them down. I had realized that those who were "succeeding" according to the criteria of the culture I was surrounded by were those who were the most successful at incorporating an active nihilism into their existence, in spite of what they were being taught. If you didn't care, it didn't matter that you failed. It didn't matter who you hurt in the process. What your goal was didn't matter as long as you acted. Action is the necessity in perpetuity.</p>
